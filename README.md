# 06-Juicy-Breakout



# This was quite the project! Below is what I have done:


Added background
Gave color to the ball, paddle, and blocks
Animated how the blocks and paddles pop up onscreen
Squeeze and shake paddle
Ball wobbles after it hits something*
Ball changes color after it hits something
Blocks fall after being hit
Blocks rotate and spin after hit
Blocks darken/fade when hit
Particle effect when block is hit
Swirling pixel tornado effect to the blocks to all blocks (idea is to clear the screen of the "pixel clusters")
Screen shake added
"BING" sound added when block is hit (**intentionally loops for chaotic effect**)
Added background music (Music by Nick Nitro:  https://soundcloud.com/ytnicknitro )
 -**BONUS** kudos to you if you can guess a certain cartoon theme remixed here.




 When you are done, *update the LICENSE and README.md*, commit and push your code to GitHub, and turn in the URL for your repository on Canvas.
